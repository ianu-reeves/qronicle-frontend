# QRonicle
QRonicle is an application that generates QR codes which can then be printed off and attached to items you want to remember. Pick up a cool statue on a trip? Write
down the memories you made & the photos you took on the trip when you got it, print out the QR code, and attach it to the bottom so when you're reminiscing later, you
can scan the code and pull the details up so it's like you're back in the market. Or maybe you've got a freezer full of food containers you always forget the contents of. Print off a QR code and put it on the fridge, then add and remove items from the entry you made on the app as you stock up or use them and save yourself the headache of pulling
piles of food out just to see if you have any pork chops on hand. The use cases for QRonicle are only limited by your imagination.

This application was initially developed for a university capstone project and has since been further developed to incorporate features & technologies that were not
known or unable to be implemented by me at the time of its development. Since that time, I have also developed a brand new front end, which you are seeing now. The source code for the back end can be
accessed [here](https://github.com/ianu-reeves/QRonicle-App).

## Note
This is a publicly accessible version of the QRonicle web application. As such, certain key files related to application properties and certifications are not included
in this distribution for security reasons. This means that while the code present in these files is the same source code used in the live deployment, downloading the
source code from this repository will not be sufficient to run the application natively on your machine.
